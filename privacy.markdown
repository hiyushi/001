  ## Our Privacy Promise

  ### We respect and protect your right to privacy

  We actively practice Privacy by Design and believe that privacy is your human right. We will do everything that can be reasonably expected to secure your information and maintain your privacy.

  ### Your data is yours

  We believe that you should control your data. We will treat any personal information you choose to share with us as a temporary custodianship, and will only use it for the specific purpose agreed when you chose to share it with us.

  ### The choice is yours

  You can freely navigate our website or send us feedback anonymously. If you want help with something specific, we’ll use the information you provide us via our [Contact Form](https://greaterthanexperience.design/contact/index.html) to tailor a response that comes directly to you. That’s the extent to which your personal information will be used.
